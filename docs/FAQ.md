# FAQ

The `organization-template` focuses only on the foundation layer for platform teams.

### How is this different from the Azure Landing Zones Library?

The Library provides enterprise-scale environments with strong governance and compliance baselines.  
The `organization-template` is lightweight and idiomatic, designed for quick bootstrap and extensibility.

### How is this different from the Azure Landing Zone Accelerator?

The Accelerator delivers opinionated Bicep and Terraform blueprints aligned with CAF.  
The `organization-template` demonstrates a simpler bootstrap using OpenTofu and AVM modules.

### Is this a full catalog of AVM modules?
